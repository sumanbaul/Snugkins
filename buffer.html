            <h2>SNUGKINS's due date calculator</h2>
            <p>Use this calculator by plugging in either the date of your last menstrual cycle or the date of conception. That's it! The pregnancy calculator will do the rest!</p>
            <h2>How is my due date calculated?</h2>
            <p>There are several ways. If you happen to know the day you conceived, you can count 38 weeks from that day to find your due date. (Human gestation takes about 38 weeks.) But very few expectant moms know exactly when they conceived. Even if
                you only had sex once during your fertile period, you wouldn't conceive on that day unless you happen to be ovulating. Sperm can live for up to five days inside your fallopian tubes. So, it could be up to five days after you have sex that
                you release an egg (ovulate) and it gets fertilized by a waiting sperm. That's the day you conceive. So without knowing the day of conception, how does anyone determine a due date?</p>
            <h2>First day of your last period</h2>
            <p>The most common way to calculate your pregnancy due date is by counting 40 weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). And that's how most healthcare providers do it. If your menstrual cycle length is the average length (28-day
                cycle), your menstrual cycle probably started about two weeks before you conceived. This explains why pregnancies are said to last 40 weeks instead of 38 weeks. This method doesn't take into account how long your menstrual cycle actually
                is or when you think you might have conceived. But generally speaking, women typically ovulate about two weeks after their menstrual cycle starts. And women are more likely to know when their last period started than the day they ovulated.</p>
            <h2>Conception date</h2>
            <p>If you do happen to know precisely when you conceived – say, if you were using an ovulation predictor kit or tracking your ovulation symptoms – you can calculate your pregnancy due date based on your conception date. Just choose that calculation
                method from the pulldown above and put in your date. Note: Again, you don't necessarily conceive on the day you have sex. But for a fun read, see our stories from parents who know when and where they did the deed that resulted in their
                child.
            </p>
            <h2>IVF transfer date</h2>
            <p>If you conceived through IVF, you can calculate your due date using your IVF transfer date. If you had a Day 5 embryo transfer, count 261 days from your transfer date. If you had a Day 3 embryo transfer, count 263 days.

            </p>
            <h2>Can my due date change?</h2>
            <p>Your healthcare provider might revise your due date if your baby is measured during a first trimester ultrasound scan and found to be much bigger or smaller than expected for gestational age. This is more likely to happen if you have an irregular
                menstrual cycle length that makes it hard to pinpoint the date of conception. Your healthcare provider will measure your baby during that ultrasound exam to figure out how far along your baby is and then provide you with a new due date.

            </p>
            <h2>What if I already know my due date?
            </h2>
            <p>If you already know your due date, you can use this calculator to see your pregnancy calendar. It will tell you when you'll hit various milestones, like when your baby's heart starts beating, and when you may be due for prenatal tests and
                prenatal care. You'll also find what your baby's sign and birthstone will probably be and which famous people were born on your due date. See BabyCenter's pregnancy week by week calendar.

            </p>
            <h2>How likely am I to give birth on my due date?
            </h2>
            <p>Of course, a due date calculation is always approximate, whether it's from our tool or from your doctor or midwife. Only 1 in 20 women delivers on her due date. You're just as likely to go into labor any day during the two weeks before or
                after. Want more information about how the weeks, months, and trimesters of pregnancy are counted? See our pregnancy timing chart.
